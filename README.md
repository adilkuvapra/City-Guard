# 🚦 CityGuard – Smart Urban Safety & Emergency Response Platform

CityGuard is a comprehensive **smart city safety platform** designed to improve urban safety through **real-time traffic monitoring, hazard detection, emergency SOS alerts, citizen reporting, and public awareness**.

Built as a hackathon project, CityGuard demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to create **life-saving digital infrastructure** for cities.
